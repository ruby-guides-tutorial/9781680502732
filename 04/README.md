## Launching Our App `@TODO`

> `config/boot.rb`

```ruby
$stdout.sync = true
```

* By convention, Compose names the network `<appname>_default`, where `appname` is inferred from the containing directory.
* using the convention `<appname>_<service_name>:latest`, again inferring the appname from the enclosing directory. In our case, this becomes myapp_web:latest.

## Other Common Tasks

```bash
docker-compose logs -f web
```
